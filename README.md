# Programming project
This repository contains a group project realized for the **Programming and Laboratory of Programming** exam at University of Rome Tor Vergata.<br>
We used 2020 annual CDC survey data of 400k adults related to their health status and applied machine learning methods to detect *patterns* from the data that can predict a patientâ€™s condition.
